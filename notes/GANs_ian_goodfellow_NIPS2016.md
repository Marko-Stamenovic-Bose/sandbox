# GAN's - Ian Goodfellow - NIPS 2016

## Generative Modeling

+ Generate a density estimation (fitting a gaussian to a distribution of points)
+ Based on training samples from a distribution, generate more samples from that same distribution.
  + GAN's generally fall in this category.
  
## Roadmap

1. Why study generative modeling.
2. How do generative models work? How do GANs compare to others.
3. How do GANs work?
4. Tips and tricks.
5. Research frontiers.
6. Combining GANs with other methods.
